            <p><strong>What are investments?</strong> Investments are ways to put your money to work so it can grow over time. Instead of keeping money in a savings account earning little interest, you can invest in things like stocks, bonds, or real estate that might increase in value.</p>
            <p><strong>When should you invest?</strong> You should invest when you have extra money after paying for your needs and building an emergency fund. It's best to start early, even with small amounts, because time helps your money grow through compound interest.</p>
            <p><strong>What profits can you get?</strong> Profits come from capital gains (selling an investment for more than you paid) and dividends or interest (regular payments from investments). Returns vary by type â€“ stocks might give 7-10% average yearly, bonds 3-5%, but past performance doesn't guarantee future results.</p>
